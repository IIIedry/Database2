I have an online car sales system, I can divide the system into two sides, one side is associated with the user, and the other with the model of the car that the dealer sells.The user registers in the online store and the user can track his order, collect it in the basket, return it back, put reviews to the dealer. And the user has an account with his data.
Then the dealer sells the car in this online store puts the characteristics, shows the model of the car, where this car comes from, how much horsepower is in this car, fills in this part for sales.

If you want to get acquainted with the system in more detail then here :
Hello, I am Iliyas Satybaldiev 210103365, my project for an online car sales store. How this is done first, the user logs into the system and registers and is assigned an identification number and his own basket where he can put the cars he likes that he wants to buy and the user has an office where data is indicated such as a phone number, the address where the car is delivered if he bought this car from a dealer.Users and dealers have a rating where they can put from 0 to 5 stars and according to this system they are given a rank, and everyone sees this rank when buying or selling. And they have the ability to track the courier who delivers these cars, and another ability to return which the user can do if there are defects or the dealer if the user does not pick up the goods.The user buys a car from a dealer and a transaction takes place during the transaction, he is asked if he wants to pay via card or cash through a courier. And here it is checked whether users can buy in cash if the user did not pay the courier 3 times before and was returned, then access to the cash settlement is blocked, then he can only buy through the card. And if he can buy in cash, then the system selects the identify password if the user does not like it, he can change it. He says this password at the end of the system and the courier receives a message that this is the right person. And he will be able to get his car and the order status changes.And he will be able to get his car and the order status changes.
then I have a part where data is given to the system through dealers. They take pictures and exhibit the car. And they indicate where these cars come from, their characteristics, their brand, model, company, and these companies will buy spare parts from suppliers
